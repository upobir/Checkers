# Checkers
The intial version is complete. It's a checkers made for educational and experimental purposes. The language used was processing and the AI opponent uses a naive minimax with alpha beta pruning.

Rules from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_draughts#Rules) are followed. However winning condition is opponent having no valid moves (no pieces or with pieces).

Use mouse left click to select things, right click will flip the board (which is only important when choosing side vs computer). Use ESC to show/hide menus.
